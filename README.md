# lambda-php

Lambda calculus interpreter in PHP.

## What?

Lambda calculus is a very minimal programming language that was invented in
1936 by Alonzo Church. It is the functional equivalent of the Turing Machine.

Lambda calculus has only three concepts: Function definitions, lexically
scoped variables, function application.

An example term would be the identity function:

    λx.x

The first part `λx` defines a function that takes an `x`, the `.` signifies
that the part that follows is the function body. The body just returns `x`.

In PHP, you would write the same thing as follows:

    function ($x) {
        return $x;
    }

You can nest function definitions. Here is a function returning a function:

    λx.λy.x

And you can also *apply* a function to an argument, which just means calling
the function.

    λf.λg.f g

Which is the short hand (left-associative) form of writing

    λf.λg.(f g)

Nested calls like:

    λf.λg.λh.f g h

Are interpreted as:

    λf.λg.λh.((f g) h)

If you want to change the grouping to be right-associative, you need to
explicitly group them in parentheses:

    λf.λg.λh.(f (g h))

Interestingly, lambda calculus is turing complete. Using just these three
concepts you can represent *any* computation.

## REPL

This project ships with a read-eval-print-loop that you can use to evaluate
lambda calculus expressions:

    $ php repl.php

By default, it is in *int-mode*, expecting the result of the expression to be
a church-encoded number. Example:

    $ php repl.php
    i> λf.λx.f (f (f x))
    3

You can switch to *bool-mode* by sending the `b` command:

    $ php repl.php
    i> b
    b> λx.λy.x
    true
